# Flame-alarm-system-
This project is a simple fire alarm system built using an Arduino Uno, flame sensor, LEDs, and a buzzer. The system monitors flame intensity and provides visual and audible alerts based on the detected levels. Itâ€™s a basic, effective solution for flame detection in small environments, with different responses based on flame intensity.
